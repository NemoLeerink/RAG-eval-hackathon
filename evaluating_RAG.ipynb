Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem.

INTRODUCTION\\nRobots that use language need it to be grounded (or situated)\\nto reference the physical world and bridge connections between\\nwords, percepts, and actions [4]. Classic methods ground language\\nusing lexical analysis to extract semantic representations that\\ninform policies [5]–[7], but they often struggle to handle unseen\\ninstructions. More recent methods learn the grounding end-to-end\\n(language to action) [8]–[10], but they require copious amounts\\nof training data, which can be expensive to obtain on real robots.\\nMeanwhile, recent progress in natural language processing\\nshows that large language models (LLMs) pretrained on Internet-\\nscale data [11]–[13] exhibit out-of-the-box capabilities [14]–[16]\\nthat can be applied to language-using robots e.g., planning a\\nsequence of steps from natural language instructions [16]–[18], tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w&lt;j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions. Inner Monologue [18]\\nexpands LLM planning by incorporating outputs from success de-\\ntectors or other visual language models and uses their feedback to, additional sparse reasoning, ReAct achieves signiﬁcantly better performance, with an absolute 10%\\nimprovement over the previous best success rate. By checking examples, we ﬁnd that ReAct is more\\nlikely to identify instruction-relevant products and options by reasoning to bridge the gap between\\nnoisy observations and actions (e.g. “For ‘space-saving ottoman bench for living room’, the item\\nhas options ‘39x18x18inch’ and ‘blue’ and seems good to buy.”). However, existing methods are\\nstill far from the performance of expert humans (Table 4), who perform signiﬁcantly more product\\nexplorations and query re-formulations that are still challenging for prompting-based methods.\\nOn the value of internal reasoning vs. external feedback\\nTo our knowledge, ReAct is the ﬁrst\\ndemonstration of combined reasoning and action using an LLM applied to an interactive environment\\nwithin a closed-loop system.

PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in\\nenvironments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on\\nmultimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in\\ngreen and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.\\nAbstract, role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task\\nspeciﬁcation in these works.

       "      <td>[Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\n5\\nRELATED WORK\\nLanguage model for reasoning\\nPerhaps the most well-known work of using LLMs for reasoning\\nis Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), which reveals the ability of LLMs to formulate their\\nown “thinking procedure” for problem solving. Several follow-up works have since been performed,\\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-\\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\\n(Madaan &amp; Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps, et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal, generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions. Inner Monologue [18]\\nexpands LLM planning by incorporating outputs from success de-\\ntectors or other visual language models and uses their feedback to, and requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen\\nlarge language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context\\nexamples to generate both domain-speciﬁc actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving\\n(Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and\\nenvironment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is\\nof primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the\\ntask-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. In contrast, for decision\\nmaking tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure 1(2)), thoughts only need to\\n1We show some GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) results in Appendix A.1, which outperforms PaLM-540B.\\n3]</td>\n",

As a proof-of-concept of such\\na shortcut bias, we associate each room type to a unique\\nwall color i.e., kitchens have red walls, bedrooms have green\\nwalls and so forth. Using our setup, we are able to evaluate\\no.o.d. generalization of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) ObjectNav\\nmethod [1] to environment where we change wall colors (e.g.\\nkitchens have blue walls).

We find that shortcut learning is the root cause: the\\nagent learns to navigate to target objects, by simply searching\\nfor the associated wall color of the target object’s room. To\\nsolve this, we propose Language-Based (L-B) augmentation. Our\\nkey insight is that we can leverage the multimodal feature\\nspace of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to augment visual\\nrepresentations directly at the feature-level, requiring no changes\\nto the simulator, and only an addition of one layer to the model.\\nWhere the SOTA ObjectNav method’s success rate drops 69%,, Shortcuts are decision rules, often learned by DNNs, which\\naid performance on a particular dataset but do not match\\nwith human-intended ones. Accordingly, they typically fail\\nwhen tested in only slightly different conditions. Prior work in\\nshortcut learning is predominantly concerned with supervised\\nlearning [22]–[24]. Similar to our work, [23] designs an\\nexperimental setup to observe whether DNNs prefer to adopt\\ncolor, shape or size shortcuts, and find DNNs naturally prefer\\ncertain shortcuts. In contrast, we study the shortcut learning\\nphenomenon in the context of DRL.\\nA common implication of shortcut learning in DRL is\\nobserved when transferring policies from simulation to the\\nreal-world [7], [8], [25]. Most policies trained in simulation\\ngeneralize poorly to the real-world due to agents adapting to\\nspecific visual details of the simulator. Prior works cope with\\nthis so-called ‘reality gap’ by domain randomization methods\\ni.e., randomizing appearances in training environments [8],, of. For instance, all kitchens in training environments might\\nhave a tiled floor.

This allows robots to use language models for planning.\\nTask Planning and Motion Planning. Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem. The use of LLMs and generality of learned low-level policies enables long-horizon, abstract\\ntasks that scale effectively to the real world, as demonstrated in our robot experiments.\\n8\\nConclusions, Limitations and Future Work\\nWe presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large, tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w<j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., sequence of steps from natural language instructions [16]–[18]\\nwithout additional model finetuning. These steps can be grounded\\nin real robot affordances from value functions among a fixed set\\nof skills i.e., policies pretrained with behavior cloning or rein-\\nforcement learning [19]–[21].

INTRODUCTION\\nRobots that use language need it to be grounded (or situated)\\nto reference the physical world and bridge connections between\\nwords, percepts, and actions [4]. Classic methods ground language\\nusing lexical analysis to extract semantic representations that\\ninform policies [5]–[7], but they often struggle to handle unseen\\ninstructions. More recent methods learn the grounding end-to-end\\n(language to action) [8]–[10], but they require copious amounts\\nof training data, which can be expensive to obtain on real robots.\\nMeanwhile, recent progress in natural language processing\\nshows that large language models (LLMs) pretrained on Internet-\\nscale data [11]–[13] exhibit out-of-the-box capabilities [14]–[16]\\nthat can be applied to language-using robots e.g., planning a\\nsequence of steps from natural language instructions [16]–[18], tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w<j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions. Inner Monologue [18]\\nexpands LLM planning by incorporating outputs from success de-\\ntectors or other visual language models and uses their feedback to, additional sparse reasoning, ReAct achieves signiﬁcantly better performance, with an absolute 10%\\nimprovement over the previous best success rate. By checking examples, we ﬁnd that ReAct is more\\nlikely to identify instruction-relevant products and options by reasoning to bridge the gap between\\nnoisy observations and actions (e.g. “For ‘space-saving ottoman bench for living room’, the item\\nhas options ‘39x18x18inch’ and ‘blue’ and seems good to buy.”). However, existing methods are\\nstill far from the performance of expert humans (Table 4), who perform signiﬁcantly more product\\nexplorations and query re-formulations that are still challenging for prompting-based methods.\\nOn the value of internal reasoning vs. external feedback\\nTo our knowledge, ReAct is the ﬁrst\\ndemonstration of combined reasoning and action using an LLM applied to an interactive environment\\nwithin a closed-loop system. Perhaps the closest prior work is Inner Monologue (IM), from Huang]  \n",

A:\\nPREDICTION:\\n Embodied language models can \\nbenefit robots by allowing them to \\nlearn language in a more natural \\nway. \\nPROMPT:\\n Language models which understand \\nrobot sensor data can\\nPREDICTION:\\n be used to generate natural \\nlanguage descriptions of the \\nrobot's environment.\\nFigure 1: PaLM-E is a single general-purpose multimodal language model for embodied reasoning tasks, visual-language tasks,\\nand language tasks. PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in\\nenvironments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on\\nmultimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in\\ngreen and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.\\nAbstract, role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task\\nspeciﬁcation in these works. In contrast, PaLM-E generates\\nhigh-level instructions as text; in doing so, the model is\\nable to naturally condition upon its own predictions and di-\\nrectly leverage the world knowledge embedded in its param-\\neters. This enables not only embodied reasoning but also\\nquestion answering, as demonstrated in our experiments.\\nAmong works that output actions, perhaps most similar is\\nthe approach proposed in Gato (Reed et al., 2022) which,\\nlike PaLM-E, is a generalist multi-embodiment agent. In\\ncontrast to Gato, we demonstrate positive transfer across\\ndifferent tasks where the model beneﬁts from diverse joint\\ntraining across multiple domains.\\nLLMs in embodied task planning.

We inherit all 8 tasks, referred as \"long-horizon\"\\ntasks due to their multi-step nature (e.g., \"put the blocks in\\nmatching bowls\"). We define 6 new tasks that require more\\nchallenging and precise spatial-geometric reasoning capabilities\\n(e.g., \"place the blocks in a diagonal line\"). Each task is\\nparameterized by some attributes (e.g., \"pick up <obj> and place\\nit in <corner>\"), which are sampled during each trial. We split the, 1) draw a 5cm hexagon around the middle\\n2) draw a line that bisects the hexagon\\n3) make them both bigger\\n4) erase the hexagon and the line\\n5) draw the sun as a circle at the top right\\n6) draw the ground as a line at the bottom\\n7) draw a pyramid as a triangle on the ground\\n8) draw a smaller pyramid a little bit to the left\\n9) draw circles around the blocks\\n10) draw a square around the sweeter fruit\\nI. Real-World Tabletop Manipulation\\nIn this domain, a UR5e robot is tasked to manipulate objects\\non a tabletop according to natural language instructions. The\\nrobot is equipped with a suction gripper, and it can only perform\\npick and place actions parameterized by 2D top-down pick and\\nplace positions. The robot is also expected to answer questions\\nabout the scene (e.g., how many blocks are there?) by using the\\nprovided perception APIs.

Several follow-up works have since been performed,\\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-\\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\\n(Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps, et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal, generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions.

However, a central aspect of our work is to solve such tasks by extracting and leveraging\\nthe knowledge in large language models. While prior works have studied how pre-trained lan-\\nguage embeddings can improve generalization to new instructions [38, 22, 21] and to new low-level\\ntasks [13], we extract much more substantial knowledge from LLMs by grounding them within the\\nrobot’s affordances. This allows robots to use language models for planning.\\nTask Planning and Motion Planning. Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem. The use of LLMs and generality of learned low-level policies enables long-horizon, abstract\\ntasks that scale effectively to the real world, as demonstrated in our robot experiments.\\n8\\nConclusions, Limitations and Future Work\\nWe presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large, tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w&lt;j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., sequence of steps from natural language instructions [16]–[18]\\nwithout additional model finetuning. These steps can be grounded\\nin real robot affordances from value functions among a fixed set\\nof skills i.e., policies pretrained with behavior cloning or rein-\\nforcement learning [19]–[21]. While promising, this abstraction\\nprevents the LLMs from directly influencing the perception-action\\nfeedback loop, making it difficult to ground language in ways that\\n(i) generalize modes of feedback that share percepts and actions\\ne.g., from \"put the apple down on the orange\" to \"put the apple\\ndown when you see the orange\", (ii) express commonsense priors\\nin control e.g., \"move faster\", \"push harder\", or (iii) comprehend\\nspatial relationships \"move the apple a bit to the left\".

Several follow-up works have since been performed,\\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-\\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\\n(Madaan &amp; Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps, et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal, generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions. Inner Monologue [18]\\nexpands LLM planning by incorporating outputs from success de-\\ntectors or other visual language models and uses their feedback to, and requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen\\nlarge language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context\\nexamples to generate both domain-speciﬁc actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving\\n(Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and\\nenvironment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is\\nof primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the\\ntask-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. In contrast, for decision\\nmaking tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure 1(2)), thoughts only need to\\n1We show some GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) results in Appendix A.1, which outperforms PaLM-540B.\\n3]</td>\n",

Like these latter works, we focus on completing temporally extended\\ntasks. However, a central aspect of our work is to solve such tasks by extracting and leveraging\\nthe knowledge in large language models. While prior works have studied how pre-trained lan-\\nguage embeddings can improve generalization to new instructions [38, 22, 21] and to new low-level\\ntasks [13], we extract much more substantial knowledge from LLMs by grounding them within the\\nrobot’s affordances. This allows robots to use language models for planning.\\nTask Planning and Motion Planning. Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem. The use of LLMs and generality of learned low-level policies enables long-horizon, abstract\\ntasks that scale effectively to the real world, as demonstrated in our robot experiments.\\n8\\nConclusions, Limitations and Future Work\\nWe presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large, tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w<j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., sequence of steps from natural language instructions [16]–[18]\\nwithout additional model finetuning. These steps can be grounded\\nin real robot affordances from value functions among a fixed set\\nof skills i.e., policies pretrained with behavior cloning or rein-\\nforcement learning [19]–[21]. While promising, this abstraction\\nprevents the LLMs from directly influencing the perception-action\\nfeedback loop, making it difficult to ground language in ways that\\n(i) generalize modes of feedback that share percepts and actions\\ne.g., from \"put the apple down on the orange\" to \"put the apple\\ndown when you see the orange\", (ii) express commonsense priors\\nin control e.g., \"move faster\", \"push harder\", or (iii) comprehend\\nspatial relationships \"move the apple a bit to the left\".

PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in\\nenvironments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on\\nmultimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in\\ngreen and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.\\nAbstract, role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task\\nspeciﬁcation in these works. In contrast, PaLM-E generates\\nhigh-level instructions as text; in doing so, the model is\\nable to naturally condition upon its own predictions and di-\\nrectly leverage the world knowledge embedded in its param-\\neters. This enables not only embodied reasoning but also\\nquestion answering, as demonstrated in our experiments.\\nAmong works that output actions, perhaps most similar is\\nthe approach proposed in Gato (Reed et al., 2022) which,\\nlike PaLM-E, is a generalist multi-embodiment agent.

In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors.

Using our setup, we are able to evaluate\\no.o.d. generalization of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) ObjectNav\\nmethod [1] to environment where we change wall colors (e.g.\\nkitchens have blue walls).

We find that shortcut learning is the root cause: the\\nagent learns to navigate to target objects, by simply searching\\nfor the associated wall color of the target object’s room. To\\nsolve this, we propose Language-Based (L-B) augmentation. Our\\nkey insight is that we can leverage the multimodal feature\\nspace of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to augment visual\\nrepresentations directly at the feature-level, requiring no changes\\nto the simulator, and only an addition of one layer to the model.\\nWhere the SOTA ObjectNav method’s success rate drops 69%,, Shortcuts are decision rules, often learned by DNNs, which\\naid performance on a particular dataset but do not match\\nwith human-intended ones.

However, a central aspect of our work is to solve such tasks by extracting and leveraging\\nthe knowledge in large language models. While prior works have studied how pre-trained lan-\\nguage embeddings can improve generalization to new instructions [38, 22, 21] and to new low-level\\ntasks [13], we extract much more substantial knowledge from LLMs by grounding them within the\\nrobot’s affordances. This allows robots to use language models for planning.\\nTask Planning and Motion Planning. Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem. The use of LLMs and generality of learned low-level policies enables long-horizon, abstract\\ntasks that scale effectively to the real world, as demonstrated in our robot experiments.\\n8\\nConclusions, Limitations and Future Work\\nWe presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large, tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w&lt;j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., sequence of steps from natural language instructions [16]–[18]\\nwithout additional model finetuning. These steps can be grounded\\nin real robot affordances from value functions among a fixed set\\nof skills i.e., policies pretrained with behavior cloning or rein-\\nforcement learning [19]–[21]. While promising, this abstraction\\nprevents the LLMs from directly influencing the perception-action\\nfeedback loop, making it difficult to ground language in ways that\\n(i) generalize modes of feedback that share percepts and actions\\ne.g., from \"put the apple down on the orange\" to \"put the apple\\ndown when you see the orange\", (ii) express commonsense priors\\nin control e.g., \"move faster\", \"push harder\", or (iii) comprehend\\nspatial relationships \"move the apple a bit to the left\".

PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in\\nenvironments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on\\nmultimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in\\ngreen and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.\\nAbstract, role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task\\nspeciﬁcation in these works. In contrast, PaLM-E generates\\nhigh-level instructions as text; in doing so, the model is\\nable to naturally condition upon its own predictions and di-\\nrectly leverage the world knowledge embedded in its param-\\neters. This enables not only embodied reasoning but also\\nquestion answering, as demonstrated in our experiments.\\nAmong works that output actions, perhaps most similar is\\nthe approach proposed in Gato (Reed et al., 2022) which,\\nlike PaLM-E, is a generalist multi-embodiment agent.

Several follow-up works have since been performed,\\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-\\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\\n(Madaan &amp; Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps, et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal, generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions. Inner Monologue [18]\\nexpands LLM planning by incorporating outputs from success de-\\ntectors or other visual language models and uses their feedback to, and requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen\\nlarge language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context\\nexamples to generate both domain-speciﬁc actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving\\n(Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and\\nenvironment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is\\nof primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the\\ntask-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps.

We\\naugment directly at feature-level, without editing individual\\nframes or any changes to the simulator.\\nWe build upon promising results from [1], where visual\\nrepresentations within the agent’s architecture are based on\\na Vision-Language Model (VLM). RGB observations are en-\\ncoded using a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP)\\n[15] visual backbone. CLIP jointly trains an image and text en-\\ncoder, such that both produce similar representations for visual\\nconcepts in images or their names in natural language. Our key\\ninsight is that we can augment agent’s visual representations\\nat feature-level, by describing variations of the dataset bias\\nin natural language. By an elegant modification to the SOTA\\narchitecture [1], with only one additional layer, we generalize\\nbetter to environments with different wall colors in ObjectNav.\\nII. RELATED WORK]</td>\n",

Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem. The use of LLMs and generality of learned low-level policies enables long-horizon, abstract\\ntasks that scale effectively to the real world, as demonstrated in our robot experiments.\\n8\\nConclusions, Limitations and Future Work\\nWe presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large, tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w<j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., sequence of steps from natural language instructions [16]–[18]\\nwithout additional model finetuning. These steps can be grounded\\nin real robot affordances from value functions among a fixed set\\nof skills i.e., policies pretrained with behavior cloning or rein-\\nforcement learning [19]–[21]. While promising, this abstraction\\nprevents the LLMs from directly influencing the perception-action\\nfeedback loop, making it difficult to ground language in ways that\\n(i) generalize modes of feedback that share percepts and actions\\ne.g., from \"put the apple down on the orange\" to \"put the apple\\ndown when you see the orange\", (ii) express commonsense priors\\nin control e.g., \"move faster\", \"push harder\", or (iii) comprehend\\nspatial relationships \"move the apple a bit to the left\".

A:\\nPREDICTION:\\n Embodied language models can \\nbenefit robots by allowing them to \\nlearn language in a more natural \\nway. \\nPROMPT:\\n Language models which understand \\nrobot sensor data can\\nPREDICTION:\\n be used to generate natural \\nlanguage descriptions of the \\nrobot's environment.\\nFigure 1: PaLM-E is a single general-purpose multimodal language model for embodied reasoning tasks, visual-language tasks,\\nand language tasks. PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in\\nenvironments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on\\nmultimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in\\ngreen and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.\\nAbstract, role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task\\nspeciﬁcation in these works. In contrast, PaLM-E generates\\nhigh-level instructions as text; in doing so, the model is\\nable to naturally condition upon its own predictions and di-\\nrectly leverage the world knowledge embedded in its param-\\neters. This enables not only embodied reasoning but also\\nquestion answering, as demonstrated in our experiments.\\nAmong works that output actions, perhaps most similar is\\nthe approach proposed in Gato (Reed et al., 2022) which,\\nlike PaLM-E, is a generalist multi-embodiment agent. In\\ncontrast to Gato, we demonstrate positive transfer across\\ndifferent tasks where the model beneﬁts from diverse joint\\ntraining across multiple domains.\\nLLMs in embodied task planning. There have been sev-\\neral methods proposed to leverage LLMs in embodied do-\\nmains.

Injecting the continuous information this way into\\nthe LLM reuses its existing positional encodings. In contrast\\nto other VLM approaches (e.g, (Chen et al., 2022)), the\\nobservation embeddings are not inserted at ﬁxed positions,\\nbut instead placed dynamically within the surrounding text.\\nEmbodying the output: PaLM-E in a robot control loop.\\nPaLM-E is a generative model producing text based on\\nmulti-model sentences as input. In order to connect the\\noutput of the model to an embodiment, we distinguish two\\ncases. If the task can be accomplished by outputting text\\nonly as, e.g., in embodied question answering or scene\\ndescription tasks, then the output of the model is directly\\nconsidered to be the solution for the task.\\nAlternatively, if PaLM-E is used to solve an embodied plan-\\nning or control task, it generates text that conditions low-]   \n",

Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps, et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors.

Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training.

Using our setup, we are able to evaluate\\no.o.d. generalization of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) ObjectNav\\nmethod [1] to environment where we change wall colors (e.g.\\nkitchens have blue walls).

We find that shortcut learning is the root cause: the\\nagent learns to navigate to target objects, by simply searching\\nfor the associated wall color of the target object’s room. To\\nsolve this, we propose Language-Based (L-B) augmentation. Our\\nkey insight is that we can leverage the multimodal feature\\nspace of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to augment visual\\nrepresentations directly at the feature-level, requiring no changes\\nto the simulator, and only an addition of one layer to the model.\\nWhere the SOTA ObjectNav method’s success rate drops 69%,, Shortcuts are decision rules, often learned by DNNs, which\\naid performance on a particular dataset but do not match\\nwith human-intended ones. Accordingly, they typically fail\\nwhen tested in only slightly different conditions. Prior work in\\nshortcut learning is predominantly concerned with supervised\\nlearning [22]–[24]. Similar to our work, [23] designs an\\nexperimental setup to observe whether DNNs prefer to adopt\\ncolor, shape or size shortcuts, and find DNNs naturally prefer\\ncertain shortcuts. In contrast, we study the shortcut learning\\nphenomenon in the context of DRL.\\nA common implication of shortcut learning in DRL is\\nobserved when transferring policies from simulation to the\\nreal-world [7], [8], [25]. Most policies trained in simulation\\ngeneralize poorly to the real-world due to agents adapting to\\nspecific visual details of the simulator.

Although a simple wall color bias might\\nbe addressed using conventional domain randomization, these\\nmethods are inconvenient considering more intricate biases\\n(e.g., a pen is always on a desk). In contrast, our method\\nutilizes free-form natural language, which allows for easily\\nadapting to different biases. Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\\ne.g., CLIP [15], allows us to augment at feature-level based, and error-prone. Instead, we take a different approach and\\npropose Language-Based (L-B) augmentation (see Fig. 1). We\\naugment directly at feature-level, without editing individual\\nframes or any changes to the simulator.\\nWe build upon promising results from [1], where visual\\nrepresentations within the agent’s architecture are based on\\na Vision-Language Model (VLM). RGB observations are en-\\ncoded using a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP)\\n[15] visual backbone. CLIP jointly trains an image and text en-\\ncoder, such that both produce similar representations for visual\\nconcepts in images or their names in natural language. Our key\\ninsight is that we can augment agent’s visual representations\\nat feature-level, by describing variations of the dataset bias\\nin natural language. By an elegant modification to the SOTA\\narchitecture [1], with only one additional layer, we generalize\\nbetter to environments with different wall colors in ObjectNav.\\nII. RELATED WORK]   \n",
       "8  [tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w. This is generally done through factorizing\\nthe probability via the chain rule to be p(W) = Πn\\nj=0p(wj|w<j), such that each successive string\\nis predicted from the previous. Recent breakthroughs initiated by neural network-based Attention\\narchitectures [2] have enabled efﬁcient scaling of so-called Large Language Models (LLMs). Such\\nmodels include Transformers [2], BERT [3], T5 [4], GPT-3 [5], Gopher [6], LAMDA [7], FLAN [8],\\nand PaLM [9], each showing increasingly large capacity (billions of parameters and terabytes of text)\\nand subsequent ability to generalize across tasks., Takeshi Kojima, Shixiang Shane Gu, Machel Reid, Yutaka Matsuo, and Yusuke Iwasawa.

    "\n",
    "Databricks has found that evaluating with LLMs can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduce costs** – fewer resources used in finding/curating benchmark datasets\n",
    "* **Save time** – fewer evaluation steps reduces time-to-release\n",
    "* **Improve automation** – easily scaled and automated, all within MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLM-as-a-Judge Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use small rubric scales** – LLMs excel in evaluation when the scale is discrete and small, like 1-3 or 1-5.\n",
    "2. **Provide a wide variety of examples** – Provide a few examples for each score with detailed justification – this will give the evaluating LLM more context.\n",
    "3. **Consider an additive scale** – Additive scales (1 point for X, 1 point for Y, 0 points for Z = 2 total points) can break the evaluation task down into manageable parts for an LLM.\n",
    "4. **Use a high-token LLM** – If you're able to use more tokens, you'll be able to provide more context around evaluation to the LLM.\n",

This allows robots to use language models for planning.\\nTask Planning and Motion Planning. Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem. The use of LLMs and generality of learned low-level policies enables long-horizon, abstract\\ntasks that scale effectively to the real world, as demonstrated in our robot experiments.\\n8\\nConclusions, Limitations and Future Work\\nWe presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large, tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w.

Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training.

PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in\\nenvironments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on\\nmultimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in\\ngreen and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.\\nAbstract, role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task\\nspeciﬁcation in these works. In contrast, PaLM-E generates\\nhigh-level instructions as text; in doing so, the model is\\nable to naturally condition upon its own predictions and di-\\nrectly leverage the world knowledge embedded in its param-\\neters. This enables not only embodied reasoning but also\\nquestion answering, as demonstrated in our experiments.\\nAmong works that output actions, perhaps most similar is\\nthe approach proposed in Gato (Reed et al., 2022) which,\\nlike PaLM-E, is a generalist multi-embodiment agent.

Several follow-up works have since been performed,\\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-\\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\\n(Madaan &amp; Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps, et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal, generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions. Inner Monologue [18]\\nexpands LLM planning by incorporating outputs from success de-\\ntectors or other visual language models and uses their feedback to, and requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen\\nlarge language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context\\nexamples to generate both domain-speciﬁc actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving\\n(Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and\\nenvironment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is\\nof primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the\\ntask-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. In contrast, for decision\\nmaking tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure 1(2)), thoughts only need to\\n1We show some GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) results in Appendix A.1, which outperforms PaLM-540B.\\n3]</td>\n",

Like these latter works, we focus on completing temporally extended\\ntasks. However, a central aspect of our work is to solve such tasks by extracting and leveraging\\nthe knowledge in large language models. While prior works have studied how pre-trained lan-\\nguage embeddings can improve generalization to new instructions [38, 22, 21] and to new low-level\\ntasks [13], we extract much more substantial knowledge from LLMs by grounding them within the\\nrobot’s affordances. This allows robots to use language models for planning.\\nTask Planning and Motion Planning. Task and motion planning [59, 60] is a problem of sequenc-\\ning tasks to solve a high-level problem, while ensuring the feasibility given an embodiment (task\\n11, planning [61, 62, 63]; motion planning [64]). Classically, this problem has been solved through\\nsymbolic planning [61, 63] or optimization [65, 66], but these require explicit primitives and con-\\nstraints. Machine learning has recently been applied to enable abstract task speciﬁcation, allow\\ngeneral primitives, or relax constraints [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. Others learn\\nto hierarchically solve such long-horizon problems [79, 80, 12, 81, 54]. SayCan leverages an LLM’s\\nsemantic knowledge about the world for interpreting instructions and understanding how to execute\\nthem. The use of LLMs and generality of learned low-level policies enables long-horizon, abstract\\ntasks that scale effectively to the real world, as demonstrated in our robot experiments.\\n8\\nConclusions, Limitations and Future Work\\nWe presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large, tionally, by evaluating the performance of the system with different LLMs, we show that a robot’s\\nperformance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\nLarge Language Models.\\nLanguage models seek to model the probability p(W) of a text\\nW = {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn}, a sequence of strings w.

PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in\\nenvironments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on\\nmultimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in\\ngreen and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.\\nAbstract, role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task\\nspeciﬁcation in these works. In contrast, PaLM-E generates\\nhigh-level instructions as text; in doing so, the model is\\nable to naturally condition upon its own predictions and di-\\nrectly leverage the world knowledge embedded in its param-\\neters. This enables not only embodied reasoning but also\\nquestion answering, as demonstrated in our experiments.\\nAmong works that output actions, perhaps most similar is\\nthe approach proposed in Gato (Reed et al., 2022) which,\\nlike PaLM-E, is a generalist multi-embodiment agent.

WebGPT (Nakano et al.,\\n2021) uses an LM to interact with web browsers, navigate through web pages, and infer answers to\\ncomplicated questions from ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019). In comparison to ReAct, WebGPT does not\\nexplicitly model the thinking and reasoning procedure, instead rely on expensive human feedback for\\nreinforcement learning. In conversation modeling, chatbots like BlenderBot (Shuster et al., 2022b)\\nand Sparrow (Glaese et al., 2022) and task-oriented dialogue systems like SimpleTOD (Hosseini-Asl\\net al., 2020) also train LMs to make decision about API calls.

In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the, Baselines\\nWe systematically ablate ReAct trajectories to build prompts for multiple baselines (with\\nformats as Figure 1(1a-1c)): (a) Standard prompting (Standard), which removes all thoughts,\\nactions, observations in ReAct trajectories.

Several follow-up works have since been performed,\\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-\\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\\n(Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps, et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\\n2022). However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal, generated procedures as an expressive way to control the robot.\\nLarge language models exhibit impressive zero-shot reasoning\\ncapabilities: from planning [14] to writing math programs [43];\\nfrom solving science problems [44] to using trained verifiers [45]\\nfor math word problems. These can be improved with prompting\\nmethods such as Least-to-Most [46], Think-Step-by-Step [15]\\nor Chain-of-Thought [47]. Most closely related to this paper are\\nworks that use LLM capabilities for robot agents without additional\\nmodel training. For example, Huang et al. decompose natural lan-\\nguage commands into sequences of executable actions by text com-\\npletion and semantic translation [14], while SayCan [17] generates\\nfeasible plans for robots by jointly decoding an LLM weighted by\\nskill affordances [20] from value functions. Inner Monologue [18]\\nexpands LLM planning by incorporating outputs from success de-\\ntectors or other visual language models and uses their feedback to, and requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen\\nlarge language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context\\nexamples to generate both domain-speciﬁc actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving\\n(Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and\\nenvironment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C).

Make sure to use them as references and to\\nunderstand them before completing the task.\\n\\nInput:\\nHow can language-based augmentation help to mitigate bias in training environments?\\n\\nOutput:\\nLanguage-based augmentation can help mitigate bias in training environments by allowing the agent to learn and generalize to different variations of the dataset bias, such as changes in environment appearances, without actually seeing images of these variations. This is done by encoding text descriptions of these variations using a vision-language model, which enables the agent to augment its visual representations at feature-level.\\n\\n\\n\\nMetric definition:\\nProfessionalism refers to the use of a formal, respectful, and appropriate style of communication that is tailored to the context and audience. It often involves avoiding overly casual language, slang, or colloquialisms, and instead using clear, concise, and respectful language.\\n\\nGrading rubric:\\nProfessionalism: If the answer is written using a professional tone, below are the details for different scores: - Score 1: Language is extremely casual, informal, and may include slang or colloquialisms. Not suitable for professional contexts.- Score 2: Language is casual but generally respectful and avoids strong informality or slang. Acceptable in some informal professional settings.- Score 3: Language is overall formal but still have casual words/phrases. Borderline for professional contexts.- Score 4: Language is balanced and avoids extreme informality or formality. Suitable for most professional contexts. - Score 5: Language is noticeably formal, respectful, and avoids casual elements. Appropriate for formal business or academic settings. \\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nExample Input:\\nWhat is MLflow?\\n\\nExample Output:\\nMLflow is like your friendly neighborhood toolkit for managing your machine learning projects.
